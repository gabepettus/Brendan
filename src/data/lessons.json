" Brendan believes that in the importance of respect, positive reinforcement and language, with a a goal aim to increase self-confidence through thoughtful encouragement. Most importantly, is he aims to spread a love of music to all of his students.", 
"Lessons are designed to fit each studentâ€™s needs and goals. Basic guitar technique is taught in every lesson and then applied to songs and pieces. For beginners, Brendan teaches basic reading, tablature, theory, and application to the style of music the student is interested in. For more advanced students, lessons are based on the students goals, however, technique and theory are still used. Students may work on a variety of styles, including but not limited to rock, blues, pop, jazz, classical or flamenco.",
"Guitar lessons can also help with audition preparation, Brendan has prepared students for auditions, and has had students accepted in music programs at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, Belmont University in Nashville, and the Conservatory of Music and Dance at the University of Missouri - Kansas City. Lessons are also good for developing confidence, general music appreciation, performance preparation, and practice for playing in a band.",
"Lessons are offering in person in Brendans Denver Park Hill studio, or online.",
